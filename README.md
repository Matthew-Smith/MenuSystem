TV Menu in WebGL
================

The contained files are runnable from index.html, However, I was not able to get the textures working without disabling web security.
Without disabling security the images show up as black. If that is the only possible method of viewing I have added a key press of '`' (tilde key)
which will disable the background images to show the movement of the menu entries.


How To Disable web security temporarily
=======================================
Create a shortcut to google chrome, right click->properties will open a dialog which shows the shortcut address. 
Adding the flag '--disable-web-security' to the end of the shortcut address will open chrome with security features disabled.
This is unadvisable for regular use, but can be used for testing purposes.
